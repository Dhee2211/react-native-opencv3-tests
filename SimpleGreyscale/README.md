For both android and ios first type 'npm install' or 'npm i' to install all the required node_modules.

For android just type 'react-native run-android' at the prompt and the app should launch on the simulator or attached android device.

For iOS, cd into the ios directory and type 'pod install' then open up the workspace in XCode and run the app on the simulator or a device.  If it doesn't run the first time around simply run it a second time not sure why that happens.

If you have issues on iOS try removing your pods directory and re-running 'pod install'.
