# react-native-opencv3-tests

Sample react native apps that expose OpenCV functionality from https://github.com/adamgf/react-native-opencv3 
on both iOS and Android.

## Build and run sample apps

`$ cd <sample-app-name>`

`$ npm install`

### Android

`$ react-native run-android`

The first time the camera apps are run they will not have required permissions so you will
have to set the permissions and then re-run the app.

### iOS

`$ cd ios`

`$ pod install`

Open generated workspace file in XCode.

Set your team appropriately for the necessary targets.

Build and run the app.
